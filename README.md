# Recon-Tools (Information Gathering)

The information-gathering phase consists of Google search engine reconnaissance, server fingerprinting, application enumeration, and more. Information gathering efforts result in a compiled list of metadata and raw output to obtain as much information about the application's makeup as possible. Reconnaissance includes web application footprinting, metafile leakage review, listing services, operating system functions, and application fingerprinting. This step maps the in-scope application to prepare for identifying exploitable vulnerabilities collectively.
